## Features

### WiFi and Bluetooth Connectivity:
The system utilizes ESP32 for seamless communication with home devices over WiFi and Bluetooth.

### Relays for Switching: 
The hardware includes relays for efficient switching of lights, fans, and other devices connected to the home automation system.

### Mobile App: 
A user-friendly mobile application is designed using MIT App Inventor, enabling users to control and monitor connected devices remotely.

### Firebase Integration: 
Firebase is used as the backend for the system, facilitating real-time communication and data synchronization between the mobile app and the home automation hardware.

## Installation

## Hardware Setup
- Insert the designed hardware into the home switch box.
- Ensure proper connections of relays and ESP32 for optimal performance.

## Software Setup
- Clone the repository from GitHub.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/home-automation.git
    cd home-automation
